# My Makefile Example
This is a demonstration of my Makefile at work.

The advantege of this Make file is, that I do not need to list the source code files of the project, and another important advantege is, that it automatically resolves dependencies. I do however need to list the include paths.
This make file assumes a perticular directory arrangement. The working directory is on the top, and under it to would find the ‘src’ directory and the ‘bin’ directory.

The ‘scr’ directory is where the source code is, and the ‘bin’ file is where the products of the compilation.
